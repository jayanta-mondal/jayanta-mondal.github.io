# Bio<hr>
Jayanta is an Engineer at [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db) who kickstarted Azure's journey in building world's first [multi-model graph database as-a-service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gremlin/introduction). He has worked on all parts of the engineering stack, often extending to customer consultation, presenting at executive briefings, evangelizing the product ([Azure Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAF8JIUUQvI), [Cosmos DB Readiness Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQf6hBLyL7k)), and contributing to the OSS ecosystem.


Jayanta holds a PhD in Computer Science from [University of Maryland, College Park](https://cs.umd.edu/) focusing on [real-time analysis on large dynamic graph](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18128/Mondal_umd_0117E_16841.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) under the guidance of Professor [Amol Deshpande](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amol/). Jayanta has been an intern at [DMX Group, Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-management-exploration-and-mining-dmx/visitors-and-interns/). 
Jayanta's work has published at top-tier database conferences like SIGMOD, SIGSAC, and EDBT. He has authored book chapters on [Continous Queries on Graph-structured Data](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4939-7131-2_391).
